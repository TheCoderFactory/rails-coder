# Module 1 of Rails Coder

## Welcome to Rails Coder @ The Coder Factory

Learning to code is going to change your life.

You are about to learn how to program computers that perform tasks, make decisions and help improve your life.

Programming uses a part of your brain that you may not have excercised much but, at least for me, is one of the most satisfying uses for our brain. Logic.

### Development environment

#### What is your setup?

Our workspace consists of a terminal, text editor and browser.

* What OS are you using?
* If on Mac, do you use RVM? RVM (Ruby Version Manager) allows us to install and use specific versions of Ruby and Rails
* Which version of Ruby? In this class we will use Ruby 2.1 but 2.0 is sufficient
* Which version of Rails? We will be using Rails 4
* Which text editor? We use Sublime on a Mac
* Do you have text editor integration with your terminal?
* Which browser?
* That's all you need!

Ruby is a scripting language that we use in addition to HTML and CSS to build our app. Rails is the FRAMEWORK and the intelligence that brings these files all together when a page loads. The Ruby in our app is what grabs the page content, the HTML structures the content, and the CSS styles the content.

We use our terminal to manipulate our files and create the different parts of our app, and we use our text editor to write and edit the app files.

Check what verison of Ruby you have installed:
```
ruby -v
```

Check what version of Rails you have installed:
``` 
rails -v
```

### Github and Heroku

Github is a cloud-based storage and backup fo your code. After working locally on some code, we upload it to Github to back it up and archive it for later.

Heroku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that is a Rails server, so it allows us to run our apps from the www with its own URL. So this allows us to test that our app works online.

* Do you have Github account? If not, sign up now.
* Do you have an Heroku account? If not, sign up now.

## Rails

Have you all seen Rails in action?

Today we are going to throw you right in the deep end by getting you to build a Rails app the 'hard way'.


### MVC

What is MVC?

Model + View + Controller

In Rails, it is actually more like Routes => Controller => Model => Controller => View

----
### Rails

Now we are going to build a Rails app the *hard way*, together.

Then we'll do it the easy/magic way.
